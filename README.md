sketch-scripts
==============

I started this repo when I was doing a little bit of contracting on Sketch, and wanted to experiment a bit with the scripting capabilities.

I now work for Bohemian, but the repo hasn't entirely caught up with that fact!

Currently it contains a few experiments and examples. When (if) I have the time, I intend to expand it...
